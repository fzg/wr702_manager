## TODO

Regarding the C version [python version abandonned]

x. Fix operand parsing: "-v -v -v ip -v" sould not be valid, as -v is an operator

x. Add argument parsing rules for missing functionalities

x. Clean up output

x. The fortunes_off file is just the concatenation of big enough words from offensive fortunes..
Of course 430KB is too big for some platforms, that's why we could 
preprocess further and in a possibly compressed way. that's on the todo.

Implement more functions:
 - Japan
 - WDS
 - uptime
 - beacon / dtim interval
 - dhcp settings
 - dhcp on/off
 - dhcp reservation
